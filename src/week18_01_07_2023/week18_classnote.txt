as they are created to be parents we can not make them final

there is no abstraction without inheritance

-difference between abstract class and class?
Class can be instantiated
we cannot create an object from an abstract class
Abstract class can not be instantiated / final. class can be


creating an object  / responsibility of implementation / parent - child


Abstract classes can contain abstract or concrete methods. However, abstract methods cannot be created in concrete classes.

we can have variables in abstract clas

abstract class is the parent class

abstract class can have all the members that custom class have


in order to cover some extra methods or partially common features we use interface

-what is diff between extends and implements
extends = 'is a', implements =include
class,abstract          implements keywords

Extend for classes, implement for interfaces

class -> class ==> extends
class -> interface ==> implements
interface -> interface ==> extends
